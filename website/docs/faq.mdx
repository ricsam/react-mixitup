## There is no animation

Make sure you have a transition property on each cell that is rendered, e.g.

```tsx
renderCell={(key, style, ref) => (
  <div
    key={key}
    ref={ref}
    style={{
      // You must set the transition property here!
      transition: 'transform 300ms linear',
      ...style
    }}
  >
    {key}
  </div>
)}
```

## I get warnings about conflicting css properties

If you see a warning like:

`Warning: Updating a style property during rerender (margin) when a conflicting property is set (marginTop) can lead to styling bugs. To avoid this, don't mix shorthand and non-shorthand properties for the same value; instead, replace the shorthand with separate values.`

During animation a few css properties are set. You can log the style arguments to renderCell and renderWrapper to debug which css styles might be conflicting.

If you have code like

```jsx
<div style={{ marginTop: 16, ...style }}>`
```

you will get the warning. The solution is to write `margin: '16px 0 0 0', ...style` instead

## My container disappears during the animation
Try setting a fixed height and width to debug if that could be the issue. If you have `dynamicDirection="off"` then react-mixitup will not set any width nor height on the wrapper.
During the animation stage all cells are positioned absolute and the parent container collapses unless it has a fixed height / width.
