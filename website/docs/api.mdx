# API

### Props

#### keys

List of unique numbers or strings identifying and representing each cell.

```tsx
keys: (string | number)[];
```

#### renderCell

Is called to render each cell.

```tsx
type RenderCell = (
  key: string | number,
  style: ICellStyle,
  ref: React.Ref<any>,
  frame: IFrame,
  activeFrame: boolean
) => React.ReactNode | JSX.Element;
```

Arguments:

- `key` - the corresponding key from the keys prop
- `style` - [ICellStyle](#icellstyle) should be passed to each cell to apply css transforms.
- `ref` - must be passed to the outer element.
  It is used to read the position of each cell (offsetLeft, offsetTop).
- `frame` - [IFrame](#iframe)
- `activeFrame` - if it is the frame which is next to be rendered, see [Terminology](./terminology)

#### renderWrapper

Is called to render the wrapper [optional]. Apply styling for how the cells should be positioned, e.g. flex or css grid

```tsx
type RenderWrapper = (
  style: IWrapperStyle,
  ref: React.Ref<any>,
  cells: JSX.Element[],
  frame: IFrame,
  activeFrame: boolean
) => React.ReactNode | JSX.Element;
```

Arguments:

- `style` - [IWrapperStyle](#iwrapperstyle) should be passed to the element to update the height
- `ref` - must be passed to the outer element.
  It is used to read the height and width of the wrapper (offsetWidth, offsetHeight).
- `cells` - list of JSX elements to be rendered
- `frame` - [IFrame](#iframe)
- `activeFrame` - if it is the frame which is next to be rendered, see [Terminology](./terminology)


#### dynamicDirection

If the wrapper should grow/shrink vertically or horizontally when adding and removing cells.

If you don't add or remove cells you can set the dynamicDirection to `'off'`. This will have some minor performance benefits
as the `COMMIT` stage is skipped.
During the `COMMIT` stage the wrapper is measured and
transition-in styles are applied.

```tsx
dynamicDirection: 'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'off';
```


import {Horizontal, Vertical, Off} from '../_examples/dynamicDirection';

Example:

<Horizontal />
<br />
<Vertical />
<br />
<Off />
<br />

#### transitionDuration
Should match the longest css transition-duration used. If 0 transitions are disabled.

```tsx
transitionDuration: number;
```

### Advanced props

#### disableTransition [optional]

Disables all transition. Same as transitionDuration = 0

```tsx
disableTransition?: boolean;
```

#### debugMeasure [optional]

Debug the measure stage.

Sets for how long in milliseconds the measure wrapper should be rendered.

By default the measure wrapper is hidden. When this prop is truthy it will be visible.

The measure wrapper should be the same width and height as the stale wrapper.
```tsx
debugMeasure?: number;
```

import {DebugMeasure} from '../_examples/debugMeasure';

Example:

<DebugMeasure />
<br />


#### reMeasureAllPreviousFramesOnNewKeys [optional]

If falsy only unmeasured frames and the previous 2 frames will be rendered.
When true all previous frames are rendered and measured each time the keys props is updated.

This has impact if the parent container resizes while multiple animations are dispatched.

If the parent container resizes each cell must be re-measured. This has a performance impact.

Thus by default only the previous 2 frames are measured.

```tsx
reMeasureAllPreviousFramesOnNewKeys?: boolean;
```


## Interfaces
### IFrame
```tsx
/**
 * IFrame
 *
 * Holds information about the keys of rendered cells
 */
export interface IFrame {
  /**
   * The height of the container when all cells are rendered.
   */
  containerHeight: number | undefined;
  /**
   * The width of the container when all cells are rendered.
   */
  containerWidth: number | undefined;
  /**
   * The keys which should be rendered
   */
  keys: (string | number)[];
  /**
   * The positions of each cell
   */
  positions: IPositions;
  /**
   * A unique index used for debugging purposes to differentiate each IFrame
   */
  index: number;
  /**
   * If the frame has been measured
   */
  hasBeenMeasured: boolean;
  /**
   * a hash generated from the keys
   */
  hash: string;
}
```

### ICellStyle
```tsx
/**
 * ICellStyle
 *
 * The styles passed to a renderCell
 */
interface ICellStyle {
  position?: 'absolute';
  top?: string;
  left?: string;
  margin?: '0px';
  transition?: string;
  transform?: string;
}
```
### IWrapperStyle
```tsx
/**
 * IWrapperStyle
 *
 * The styles passed to the renderWrapper
 */
interface IWrapperStyle {
  // position absolute in MEASURE stage and position relative in ANIMATE and COMMIT stage
  // undefined in STALE stage
  position?: 'absolute' | 'relative';
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  visibility?: 'hidden';
  zIndex?: -1;
}
```
