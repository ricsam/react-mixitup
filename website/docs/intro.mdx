# Tutorial Intro

Let's discover **react-mixitup in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Install react-mixitup

```sh
npm install react-mixitup
```

### What you'll need

- [react](https://reactjs.org/) version 16.8 or above
- A browser supporting [transitions](https://caniuse.com/css-transitions) and [transforms](https://caniuse.com/transforms2d):
  - over 98% of web users browse in a supported browser

## Render the component

:::note Terminology

The naming used in react-mixitup is based on the use case of rendering a table.

- **cell** - a table cell
- **wrapper** - a parent container to the cells, i.e. the container holding the rows and columns
- **frame** - each set of keys that are passed instanciates a frame which holds DOM data about each rendered cell
- **stage** - the stage determines what should be returned by ReactMixitup. The StageType is: `STALE | MEASURE | COMMIT | ANIMATE`,

:::

Example:


```jsx
const [keys, setKeys] = React.useState([1,2,3]);

<button onClick={() => setKeys(keys[0] === 1 ? [3,2,1] : [1,2,3])}>Mixitup</button>
<ReactMixitup
  // unique list of keys to identify each cell.
  keys={keys}
  // is called to render each cell. ref and style must be passed
  renderCell={(key, style, ref) => (
    <div
      key={key}
      ref={ref}
      style={{
        transition: 'transform 300ms linear',
        ...style,
      }}
    >
      {key}
    </div>
  )}
  // Optional. ref and style must be passed
  renderWrapper={(style, ref, cells) => {
    return (
      <div
        style={{
          transition: 'height 300ms ease',
          ...style
        }}
        ref={ref}
      >
        {cells}
      </div>
    );
  }}
  // when adding and removing cells, should the wrapper grow/shrink vertically or horizontally?
  dynamicDirection="vertical"
  // the transitionDuration should match the transition on renderCell / renderWrapper
  transitionDuration={300}
/>
```

### Props

**keys** - list of unique numbers or strings identifying and representing each cell

```tsx
keys: (string | number)[];
```

**renderCell** - is called to render each cell

```tsx
type RenderCell = (
  key: string | number,
  style: ICellStyle,
  ref: React.Ref<any>
) => React.ReactNode | JSX.Element;
```

Arguments:

- `key` - the corresponding key from the keys prop
- `ref` - must be passed to the outer element.
  It is used to read the position of each cell (offsetLeft, offsetTop).
- `style` - should be passed to each cell to apply css transforms.

Interfaces:

```tsx
interface ICellStyle {
  position?: 'absolute';
  top?: 0;
  left?: 0;
  margin?: 0;
  transform?: string;
}
```

**renderWrapper** - is called to render the wrapper [optional]. Apply styling for how the cells should be positioned, e.g. flex or css grid

```tsx
type RenderWrapper = (
  style: IWrapperStyle,
  ref: React.Ref<any>,
  cells: JSX.Element[]
) => React.ReactNode | JSX.Element;
```

Arguments:

- `style` - should be passed to the element to update the height
- `ref` - must be passed to the outer element.
  It is used to read the height and width of the wrapper (offsetWidth, offsetHeight).
- `cells` - list of JSX elements to be rendered

Interfaces:

```tsx
interface IWrapperStyle {
  position?: 'absolute' | 'relative';
  width?: number;
  height?: number;
  top?: 0;
  left?: 0;
  visibility?: 'hidden';
  zIndex?: -1;
}
```

**dynamicDirection** - if the wrapper should grow/shrink vertically or horizontally when adding and removing cells.

If you don't add or remove cells you can set the dynamicDirection to `'off'`. This will have some minor performance benefits
as the wrapper doesn't need to be measured and the `COMMIT` stage is skipped.

```tsx
dynamicDirection: 'horizontal' | 'vertical' | 'off';
```


import {Horizontal, Vertical, Off} from '../_examples/dynamicDirection';

Example:

<Horizontal />
<br />
<Vertical />
<br />
<Off />
<br />

**transitionDuration** - should match the longest transition-duration used

```tsx
transitionDuration: number;
```

### Advanced props

**disableTransition** - [optional] disables all transition
```tsx
disableTransition?: boolean;
```

**debugMeasure** - [optional] debug the measure stage

Sets for how long in milliseconds the measure wrapper should be rendered.

By default the measure wrapper is hidden. When this prop is truthy it will be visible.

The measure wrapper should be the same width and height as the stale wrapper.
```tsx
debugMeasure?: number;
```

import {DebugMeasure} from '../_examples/debugMeasure';

Example:

<DebugMeasure />
<br />


**reMeasureAllPreviousFramesOnNewKeys** - [optional]

If falsy only unmeasured frames and the previous 2 frames will be rendered.
When true all previous frames are rendered and measured each time the keys props is updated.

This has impact if the parent container resizes while multiple animations are dispatched.

If the parent container resizes each cell must be re-measured. This has a performance impact.

Thus by default only the previous 2 frames are measured.

```tsx
reMeasureAllPreviousFramesOnNewKeys?: boolean;
```
