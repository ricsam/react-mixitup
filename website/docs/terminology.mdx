# Terminology

The naming used in react-mixitup is based on the use case of rendering a table.

- **cell** - a table cell
- **wrapper** - a parent container to the cells, i.e. the container holding the rows and columns
- **frame** - each set of keys that are passed instanciates a frame which holds DOM data about each rendered cell
- **active frame** - the frame with the set of keys which were last provided to ReactMixitup
- **stage** - the stage determines what should be returned by ReactMixitup. The StageType is: `STALE | MEASURE | COMMIT | ANIMATE`,


## Stages

### STALE
This is the default stage where each cell is rendered statically

### MEASURE
This is the stage when the wrapper is rendered with position absolute and visibility hidden.
The size of the wrapper and the position of each cell is measured using the ref that is passed to `renderWrapper`.

### COMMIT
In this stage initial styles are added.
Those styles include setting a fixed height or width on the wrapper,
setting `transform: scale(0)` on each new cell and moving cells into their current position.

### ANIMATE
In animate cells are translated into their final position and appearing cells are scaled to 1 and disappearing cells
are scaled to 0. The wrapper height is changed to the height of the active frame.
